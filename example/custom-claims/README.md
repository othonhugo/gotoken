# Custom Claims Example

This example demonstrates how to extend the standard token structure with application-specific data. It shows how to include custom information within tokens while maintaining compatibility with the core functionality.

## Scope

This example covers:

- **Data Extension**: Adding custom fields to the standard structure
- **Type Safety**: Defining structured data types for custom information
- **Serialization**: Ensuring custom data is properly encoded and decoded
- **Practical Application**: Using domain-specific information in tokens

## Learning Objectives

After reviewing this example, you should understand:

- How to define custom data structures that extend the base functionality
- The process of encoding and decoding custom information
- Best practices for organizing application-specific data
- How custom data integrates with standard validation

## Use Case

This example is ideal for:

- Applications requiring domain-specific information in tokens
- Scenarios where standard claims are insufficient
- Understanding data extension patterns
- Implementing role-based access control or user metadata storage
