# Package Directory

This directory contains the core implementation modules that provide the fundamental functionality of the library. It houses the internal components that power the public-facing interface.

## Scope

The modules within this directory are responsible for:

- Implementing the core business logic and algorithms
- Providing reusable components and utilities
- Defining internal data structures and operations
- Encapsulating implementation details away from the public interface

## Organization

Each subdirectory represents a distinct functional domain or module, containing its implementation files and associated test suites.
