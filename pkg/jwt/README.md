# Token Processing Module

This module implements the core token processing functionality, including creation, validation, and verification of cryptographically signed tokens.

## Scope

This module is responsible for:

- **Token Creation**: Generating secure, signed tokens from structured data
- **Token Validation**: Verifying the integrity and authenticity of tokens
- **Encoding/Decoding**: Converting between different representations of token data
- **Error Handling**: Defining and managing token-related error conditions
- **Serialization**: Managing the transformation of structured data to and from token format

## Components

The module contains several focused components:

- **Core Logic**: Token creation and validation algorithms
- **Encoding Utilities**: Data encoding and decoding operations
- **Serialization**: Data structure transformation
- **Error Definitions**: Comprehensive error types for various failure scenarios
- **Test Suites**: Validation of all functionality through comprehensive tests
